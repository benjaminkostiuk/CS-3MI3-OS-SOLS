# COMPSCI 3MI3 Open-Sourced Solutions
Compilation of student solutions to projects and assignments for COMPSCI 3MI3.

As stated by Professor Nick Moore:

> I would also like to remind everyone that it is not academic dishonesty to seek out a correct answer to a question from your classmates *after* said question has been marked.

Now I would invite you to seek out a correct answer from your classmates *in this repo*.
